This is a "helping hands" base for the "PANAVISE model 201 Junior"
vise.

The vise can be screwed to the base using M6 bolts and nuts.

The base is designed for "1/4PT Flexible Oil Coolant Pipe Hose" to be
used as the "helping hands".  The threads are designed into the model,
so the coolant pipes should screw into the base.

Alligator clips are attached to the end of the coolant pipes by
drilling out the holes to fit the alligator clips.  The clips are
permanently attached with super glue (cyanoacrylate).  Heat shrink
tubing can be applied to the teeth of the clips to reduce scratches.
